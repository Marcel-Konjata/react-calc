Used react-app with yarn, styled components.

to be honest Someone told me that every Junior Dev should be able to construct calculator,
I have naturally resistance to math but, found a something that I didn't realise due to event propagation and bubbling is har to do same event assigned to 
2 different triggers.

calc works on both input but for predictability of events, if u click and than want to press keys u have to click outside the calc

I got for class-based approach with render prop instead hooks, just personal preference (kinda like classes, reminds me oop);
